Well, the tyrant model is awesome, but didn't have any special 
.wav files for it so I cooked up some of my own, hope you like them, 
I always like my voice to be heard...well hehe, IT IS GOING TO BE HEARD 
NOW!!!
Just unzip this puppy in your "tyrant" folder file and FRAG ON!

Skins? Yeah I do them...
